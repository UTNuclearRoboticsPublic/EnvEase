# nrg_bash

This is a set of bash scripts for automating and managing the Linux environment setup for NRG members. It handles the setup of ROS1 and/or ROS2 environments, and downloads and sources bash alias files for your specific robot platforms and projects.

## Installation and Uninstallation
Follow these steps to set up these automated features on your Ubuntu machine.

<ol>
  <li>Clone this repo to your home directory.</li>
  
      git clone git@github.com:UTNuclearRobotics/nrg_bash.git ~/
      
  <li>Run the install script. This will place bash scripts in the location /opt/nuclearrobotics, install the nrgenv program to /bin, and place a configuration directory .nrg_env in your home directory. After running the install script, you may delete the nrg_bash directory.</li>
  
      ~/nrg_bash/install.sh
      
  <li>To uninstall these features, run the uninstall script located in the nrg_bash directory.</li>
  
      ~/nrg_bash/uninstall.sh
      
</ol>

## NRG Environment Configuration

After installation, you will have access to the ```nrgenv``` program which enables you to create and manage environment profiles from the command line. These profiles allow you to switch between different work contexts (projects, platforms, or toolsets) without editing your bashrc script. An example workflow is given below.

<ol>
  <li>After installation, you will initially not have any stored environment configurations. Create one using the nrgenv tool. The new configuration file will be opened in your default text editor. Fill out the configuration per the comments in the file, then save and close.</li>
  
      nrgenv add first_config
      
  <li>Then set the newly created configuration as the active configuration.</li>
  
      nrgenv set first_config
      
  <li>After setting a new active configuration, you must source your bashrc script. Conveniently, the included NRG alias set provides a command for this.</li>
  
      source_bashrc
      
  <li>After sourcing the bashrc, you can check the active environment configuration.</li>
  
      nrgenv show
</ol>

The variables you set in the ```first_config``` configuration file should be reflected in your bash environment going forward. You may go on to create more configurations for different work contexts, and switch between them as needed using ```nrgenv```. You can view the full instruction set of ```nrgenv``` by running it with the help flag.

    nrgenv -h

## Bash Alias Management
The script will source any alias files that you specify in the ```platform_aliases``` and ```project_aliases``` variables of the environment configuration. For example, setting

    platform_aliases=("spot" "walrus")  
    
will cause the script to download the files ```spot_aliases``` and ```walrus_aliases``` from GitHub, and source them. The script will always source the file ```nrg_common_aliases``` as well.

You are strongly encouraged to add and maintain alias files for your robot platforms and projects, to aid other NRG members in using your work. Do so by commiting to the [aliases repository](https://github.com/UTNuclearRobotics/nrg_bash_aliases).

You may also put personal aliases in ```~/.bash_aliases``` as usual. This should only be for aliases that are very specific to your own needs that other NRG members would not benefit from having access to.
